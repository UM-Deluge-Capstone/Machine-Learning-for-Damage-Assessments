This folder contains images, labels, notebooks, and videos to help introduce the machine learning alogrithm, YOLOv5, into damage assessments for disaster recovery.
To begin, download the entire annotated dataset with corresponding files from the folder "Street-Level Damage Dataset".
Once downloaded and unzipped, these files are ready to be integrated into machine learning algorithms.
