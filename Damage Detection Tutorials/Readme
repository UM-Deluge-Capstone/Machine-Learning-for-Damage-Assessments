This folder contains images, labels, notebooks, and videos for machine learning purposes. 

If you are interested in utilizing a pre-annotated dataset for object detection, follow these instructions:
1. Download the entire annotated dataset with corresponding files from the folder "Street-Level Damage Dataset".
2. Once downloaded and unzipped, these files are ready to be integrated into machine learning algorithms.

If are interested in following along a custom tutorial for street level damage assessment, please follow these instructions:
1. Navigate to our Youtube series: https://www.youtube.com/channel/UC4IN_bbvUUc_b3gLA8pwO6w 
OR check out the downloaded videos in the Youtube Series folder. 
2. Navigate to Roboflow and sign up for a free account.
3. Download the entire annotated dataset with corresponding files from the folder "Street-Level Damage Dataset".
4. Once downloaded and unzipped, upload the dataset to a Roboflow project.
OR upload unannotated images from your personal collection. Annotate these in Roboflow. 
5. Download the custome notebook called "*Linked* Damage_Assessment_YOLOv5_Custom_Training.ipynb" 
6. Follow the video tutorial.
