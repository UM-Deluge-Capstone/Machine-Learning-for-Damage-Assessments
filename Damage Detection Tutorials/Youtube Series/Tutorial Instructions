Welcome! 

Here you will find a step by step guide on how to integrate machine learning into the damage assessment processes. 
- Start by watching the introductory video "Machine Learning for Damage Assessments"
- Steps 1-5 address how to set up a dataset for machine learning through Roboflow
- Steps 6-12 address how to integrate a Roboflow dataset into a custom notebook for YOLOv5 algorithm training. 

All of the data used, including images, labels, and notebooks, are imbedded in the "Damage Detection Tutorials" folder.
