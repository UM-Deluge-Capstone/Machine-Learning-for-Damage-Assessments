# Machine Learning for Damage Assessments
A group of graduate student researchers from the University of Michigan collected and published this ML tutorial to aid damage assessment processes. This repository contains information and data for other researchers to replicate on their own. Using object detection algorithms, this tutorial will demonstrate one machine learning method for damage detection using YOLOv5.
